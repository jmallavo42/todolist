User inputs new todo
User inputs quit or q
User inputs list
User inputs new
User inputs deleted

	1. Prompt the user "what would you like to do?" and save it to a variable input (note to use let because it will be reused later on);
	2. Create an array with at least two items and save it as a constant variable todos;
	3. Create a while loop so that when a user input is not exactly equal to "quit or "q" as the first thing then its done but if they  donâ€™t, continuously prompt the user again.

	1. If user input is exactly equal to list 
	2. then console log a lot string of asterisks

	1. Loop over array using i (start at index 0 then keep looping and incrementing I until highest index in the todos array is met, then stop before hitting the length of the array.
	2. Console log a string template literal, showing index and array;
	3. Console log a lot of asterisks

	1. Add another conditional check else if user input is exactly equal to "new" to implement a new to do. 
	2. Prompt the user "Ok, what is the new to do?" and save it to a new variable constant newTodo;
	3. Take the result which will be a string by adding todos and pushing newTodo to the end of a new array;
	4. Console log with a string template literal showing the newTodo "added to the list!")

	1. Add another conditional check else if user input is exactly equal to "delete" to delete a to do. 
	2. Add a new constant index  then prompt "Ok, enter an index to delete:" then parseInt to make sure user is entering a number;
	3. Check if number is not a number of index (meaning its valid)
	4. Splice from the user's index and only one for element from todos variable and save it to a new constant deleted;
	5. Then console log with a string template literal array `Ok, deleted (then the todos that was deleted);
	6. Else console log "Unknown index");
	7. Prompt user "what would you like to do?"
Console log "ok you quit the app"
